# Dependency Management

## Overview

This document outlines the dependency management strategy for the Terraform Spotify Provider. Proper dependency management is crucial for ensuring reproducible builds, maintaining security, and keeping the provider up-to-date with the latest features and bug fixes.

## Versioning Strategy

### Pinned Dependencies

All dependencies in this project are pinned to specific versions in the `go.mod` file. This ensures:

- **Reproducible builds**: Anyone building the provider will get the same dependency versions
- **Stability**: Prevents unexpected changes from dependency updates
- **Predictability**: Makes upgrade paths more controlled and deliberate

### Go Version

The Go version is explicitly pinned in the `go.mod` file to ensure consistent behavior across different development environments.

## Dependency Update Process

### Regular Updates

We follow these guidelines for dependency updates:

1. **Schedule**: Dependencies should be reviewed and updated at least once per month
2. **Security updates**: Critical security patches should be applied as soon as possible
3. **Major version upgrades**: Should be carefully planned and tested

### Update Procedure

1. Run the dependency update script:
   ```
   ./scripts/update_dependencies.sh
   ```

2. Review the proposed changes

3. Run tests to ensure everything still works:
   ```
   make test
   ```

4. Check for security vulnerabilities in the updated dependencies:
   ```
   # Using Nancy (if installed)
   go list -json -m all | nancy sleuth
   
   # Or using another security scanning tool
   ```

5. Commit the changes with a descriptive message:
   ```
   git commit -m "chore: update dependencies [security]"
   ```

## Dependency Audit

A full dependency audit should be performed quarterly to:

1. Remove unused dependencies
2. Identify outdated dependencies
3. Check for known security vulnerabilities
4. Ensure all licenses are compatible with this project

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after updating dependencies:

1. Try reverting to the previous versions in `go.mod`
2. Check the changelog of the updated dependencies for breaking changes
3. Run `go mod tidy` to ensure consistency

## Best Practices

- Always pin dependencies to specific versions
- Document significant dependency changes in release notes
- Keep the Go version reasonably current but stable
- Regularly check for security advisories for all dependencies
